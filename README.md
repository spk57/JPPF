## Julia Programmers Personal Finance Tools

Collection of Personal Fiance tools 
This is a collection of tools which can be used by a programmer to help manage personal finance.  I started this activity becuase commercial tools lack the flexibility I was looking for.   The approach is to leverage standard tools like Excel, Jupyter.  Written in Julia just because its my favorite language.  

* Budget Analysis
* Investment Analsis
* Retirement Planning

Technology usage: Julia, Excel, Jupyter
